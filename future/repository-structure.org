#+TITLE: Repository Structure Ideas
#+STARTUP: overview

* Original Structure Concept

The original Fun Police concept used a tech-stack specific organization:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
fun-police/
 |-- {tech-stack}/
 |   |-- tests/         # Architectural Compliance unittests
 |   |-- policies/      # The Rules, in plain english
 |   |-- CONVENTIONS.md # Semantic entry point for context injection
 |-- README.md          # For when you need to understand the fun police
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Key Ideas Worth Preserving

1. *Tech-stack Specificity*: Different tech stacks have different architectural requirements and conventions.

2. *Tests and Policies Duality*: The combination of forward-looking policies and backward-looking tests creates a complete system.

3. *Playbook Concept*: Tech-stacks function as complete playbooks with cohesive bundles of policies and tests.

* Integration with Current Approach

The current org-mode based memory bank system could potentially be extended with tech-stack specific variants, combining the best of both approaches.
