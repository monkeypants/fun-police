# AI Integration Ideas

## Original AI Integration Concept

The original Fun Police concept used a simple command to load conventions:

```
When working with the fun police, you have to invite them into your context.

    `/read-only some/path/.fun_police/CONVENTIONS`

Then, your AI assistant should become "fun police enabled".
```

## Key Ideas Worth Preserving

1. **Explicit Invitation**: AI assistants must be explicitly invited to enforce architectural standards.

2. **Context Loading**: A simple mechanism for loading the architectural context.

3. **Behavior Modification**: Once loaded, the AI assistant's behavior changes to enforce standards.

## Integration with Current Approach

The current instructions.org provides much more sophisticated guidance for AI assistants. A simple command could be developed to load the entire memory bank, combining the simplicity of the original approach with the depth of the current system.
