# Explanatory Analogies

## Original Analogies

The original README.md used two powerful analogies:

### Accounting and Finance Analogy

"The management analogy is Accounting and Finance. The difference between these two things is that accounting is about the past (historical facts), and finance is about the future (sensible guessing). The fun police cover both responsibilities. The accountant (test suite) runs _after_ code is written, and the financiers (conventions) are evaluated _before_."

### Race Car Analogy

"The executive analogy is a high performance race car. Software Architecture Policies are the engine that accelerates the creation of high-quality software. Architecture compliance unittests are the brakes that quickly and effectively keep the car on the track when it suddenly needs to change speed or direction."

## Key Ideas Worth Preserving

1. **Dual Nature**: The concept that architectural enforcement has both forward-looking and backward-looking components.

2. **Balance Requirement**: The insight that policies and tests must be maintained together to be effective.

3. **Acceleration and Control**: The understanding that good architecture both enables speed and provides safety.

## Integration with Current Approach

These analogies remain powerful explanatory tools and could be incorporated into the current documentation to help explain the purpose and value of the memory bank system.
