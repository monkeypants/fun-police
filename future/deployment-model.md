# Deployment Model Ideas

## Original Deployment Concept

The original Fun Police concept used a ".fun_police" directory within the target repository:

```
repo/
 |-- some/
     |-- path/
     |   |--.fun_police/     # the "police station"
     |   |   |-- CONVENTIONS
     |   |   |-- tests/
     |   |   |-- other_files...
     |   |-- {your files}    # the stuff that is policed
     |   |-- {subdirs/}      # also, all the way down
     |-- {other stuff}       # outside of the jurisdiction, not policed
```

## Key Ideas Worth Preserving

1. **Police Station Concept**: A dedicated directory containing all enforcement tools and policies.

2. **Jurisdictional Boundaries**: Clear definition of which parts of the codebase are subject to architectural enforcement.

3. **Local Integration**: The enforcement tools live within the project they police, ensuring they evolve together.

## Integration with Current Approach

The current memory bank system could potentially be deployed within a ".fun_police" directory, maintaining the original concept while using the more sophisticated org-mode based approach.
